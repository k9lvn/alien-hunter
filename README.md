# alien-hunter

### To Run

Just run `javac AlienGame.java && java AlienGame` and the menu should appear!

### Side note

- The icon for the alien can be changed, for both alive and dead - just change the icons name to `alien.png` and `alien dead.png` after you replaced them

- This is an old project so some things are not as refined as I would like it to be :c

### Known issues
- The highscore button is broken
